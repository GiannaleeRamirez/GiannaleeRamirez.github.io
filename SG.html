                South korea's current president: Moon Jae-in
                South Korea is a democratic country, its people will vote for a president. Their government is somewhat similar to the US government as it was highly influenced by the U.S. The president is head of state and of a multi-party system. South Korea also has a strong capitalist economy. The people living in this country are given the right to free speech, press, petition, and assembly. 
                People found guilty of crimes in South Korea would go to a prison where they are free to move in and it is professionally protected and well-kept.
