                North Korea Current dictator- Kim Jong Un
                North Korea is run by totalitarian leaders, which means the power is passed down through family. 
                This makes their government very similar to a monarchy. This country is solely communist but also socialist. 
                Also, the people in power will try very hard to make sure they will be the successor after their dictator's death. 
                In North Korea basic human rights are denied by the dictator. There isn't any freedom of speech, religion, press, even movement. 
                People living in this country are constantly under surveillance and if they do anything against their government they will be sent to prison camps which are known to commanly execute and torture their inmates.
