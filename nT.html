                There aren't many things available on North Korean television. Most of the North Korean population don't even own a TV. For those few that do have access to a television some of them would even go to lengths to buy smuggled shows and movies coming in from China, this is very dangerous and very expensive. Sometimes even when they watch these smuggled in shows they are amazed and cannot believe these things are real.
                Somethings that North Koreans can watch are- Korean Central Television, Mansudae, Athletic Television and Ryongnamsan
                These channels are 100% controlled by the government and more similar to news anchors talking about the great things their dictator does.
